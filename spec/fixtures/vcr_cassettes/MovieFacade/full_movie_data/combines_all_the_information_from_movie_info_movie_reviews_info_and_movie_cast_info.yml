        sequel to the first movie. In something more meditative and unhurried, in
        something more philosophically meaningful than its legendary predecessor.
        Backstage games and backstage talks replaced the dramatic mood swings of the
        main characters and the exchange of fire.\r\n\r\nThe second film continues
        the story of Michael Carleone in the role of the Godfather, and also complements
        the family story with scenes of the formation of the young Vito Andolini and
        his escape to America. The difficult choice of being young Don, his sphere
        of expansion of influence opens up new heights and horizons, but also acquires
        new enemies. Big money and power always keep pace with great temptation, and
        therefore you should always keep your ears open. After all, the knife in the
        back can insert exactly the one from whom you do not expect ...","created_at":"2019-07-30T08:28:10.884Z","id":"5d3fff9ab87aec6aa339e228","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:24.936Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d3fff9ab87aec6aa339e228"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Building
        on the first volume, this self-adaptation by writer Mario Puzo and director
        Francis Ford Coppola develops the story of the new Don - \"Michael\" (Al Pacino).
        His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses
        see him associating with the duplicitous \"Hyman Roth\" (Lee Strasberg) in
        Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be
        a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty
        of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel
        thread depicting how his father \"Vito\" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence
        after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of \"Don
        Ciccio\". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit
        the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven
        storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert
        Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing
        out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota
        score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael''s efforts to build
        upon (and honour) his father''s legacy, before he loses all of his own, once
        prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on
        super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure
        and I reckon this is every bit as good at the \"Godfather\" (1972).","created_at":"2022-04-04T16:39:54.710Z","id":"624b1f5a1c6329004ec03965","updated_at":"2022-04-04T16:39:54.710Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624b1f5a1c6329004ec03965"},{"author":"drystyx","author_details":{"name":"","username":"drystyx","avatar_path":"/hLLsAvAnVT0cFU7JuuaaItTWXv8.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"This
        Hollywood style formula movie about mobsters isn''t as pathetic as the first
        or third one, simply because it is too dull and poorly directed to stay awake
        through.\r\nIt''s basically just a bunch of scenes of people \"talking tough\"
        or getting killed, with no point.\r\nIf you''re looking for a plot or story,
        forget it. There is none. It''s a muddled mess. It appears that by the end,
        the chief mobster is in anguish over whether or not to kill his brother. \r\nWhy?
        Who knows? None of this makes sense to those of us who aren''t born with some
        super psychic ESP. \r\nIt also appears there''s some revenge, but we never
        know why, or who, or what. It''s just a poorly directed and poorly written
        mess.\r\nIt does cure Insomnia, though, which is why it gets a 2 rating instead
        of a 1.","created_at":"2023-04-02T16:19:11.302Z","id":"6429aaffc0442901f002ad45","updated_at":"2023-04-03T16:45:18.611Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6429aaffc0442901f002ad45"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}'
